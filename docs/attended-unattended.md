## Attended vs Unattended Automation

### Attended Automation 

Attended bots act like virtual assistants for employees. They are manually triggered and typically run on the user's machine. These bots are designed to assist with front-office tasks where human interaction is part of the workflow.

* Triggering: Initiated by a user (e.g., button click, event).
    * Triggered via OpCon **Self Service**.
* Location: Runs on the userâ€™s desktop or workstation

* Use Cases:
    * Customer service agents pulling data during calls.
    * Submitting expense reports.
    * Onboarding new employees with guided steps.

* Benefits:
    * Enhances employee productivity.
    * Supports real-time decision-making.
    * Requires minimal setup and is user-friendly.


### Unattended Automation 

Unattended bots operate autonomously, executing tasks based on schedules or system triggers. These bots are ideal for back-office operations and can run on dedicated servers or cloud environments.

* Triggering: Automatically triggered by schedules or system events.
    * Orchestrated via OpCon on runner machines.
* Location: Runs on servers or virtual machines.

* Use Cases:
    * Invoice processing.
    * Claims documentation.
    * Inventory updates.
    * Payroll automation.

* Benefits:
    * Enables end-to-end automation.
    * Operates 24/7 without human intervention.
    * Reduces operational costs and errors.
  

### Hybrid Automation 

Hybrid automation combines both attended and unattended bots. For example, an attended bot might collect data and then trigger an unattended bot to process it in the background.

* Use Cases:
    * Employee onboarding: Attended bot collects user input, unattended bot updates systems.
    * Customer invoicing: Attended bot verifies details, unattended bot sends invoices.

* Benefits:
    * Seamless collaboration between human and bot.
    * Flexibility in automation design.
