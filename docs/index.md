## VisualCron RPA Training Guide

VisualCron RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is a Windows-based automation and task scheduling platform that enables organizations to automate repetitive, rule-based processes without requiring programming expertise. It works by recording human interactions (such as keystrokes and mouse clicks) and replaying them to perform tasks across desktop, web, or hybrid environments.

This training guide provides examples of basic use cases as well as instructions on orchestrating a VisualCron RPA process with OpCon.
